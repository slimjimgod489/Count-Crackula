Upon running the .py file, you will be prompted what on what type of encyrption you are wanting to break, and then you can input the encrypted text into the input, and then asks if you want to linearly bruteforce, or spray.
The code will first iterate through a file of the top 10k most common passwords, then iterates through the entire English dictionary before trying to bruteforce the code.

It's sooo awesome to have coding.
